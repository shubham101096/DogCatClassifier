# DogCatClassifier
An iOS app used to classify captured image as a dog or a cat.
I have used dog and cat image dataset from kaggle website to create and train my model using CreateML. Then I imported this model to my Xcode Project and used CoreML and Vision frameworks to classify the image captured using camera.
